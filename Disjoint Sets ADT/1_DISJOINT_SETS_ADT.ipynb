To achieve this, we use the Disjoint Sets Abstract Data Type (ADT), which is particularly useful for solving equivalence problems. The implementation of this ADT is straightforward, requiring only a simple array, and each function can be implemented with just a few lines of code.\n",

        "We'll explore the concept of equivalence relations within a set, assuming that S contains the elements and a relation R is defined on it. The relation R can be either true or false for any pair of elements a and b in S. If a R b is true, we say that a is related to b; otherwise, a is not related to b. An equivalence relation is one that adheres to the following properties:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reflexive:** For every element a in S, a R a is true.\n",
        "- **Symmetric:** For any two elements a and b in S, if a R b is true, then b R a is also true.\n",
        "- **Transitive:** For any three elements a, b, and c in S, if a R b and b R c are true, then a R c is true.\n",

        "\n",
        "On the other hand, rail connectivity is an example of an equivalence relation. It's reflexive because any location is connected to itself. It's symmetric because if there's connectivity from city a to city b, there's also connectivity from city b to city a. Finally, it's transitive because if city a is connected to city b and city b is connected to city c, then city a is also connected to city c.\n",
        "\n",
        "The equivalence class of an element a in S is a subset of S that contains all the elements related to a. These equivalence classes create a partition of S, ensuring that every member of S appears in exactly one equivalence class. To determine if a is related to b (a R b), you need to check if they belong to the same equivalence class.\n",
