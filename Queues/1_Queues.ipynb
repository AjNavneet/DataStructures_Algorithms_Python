        "# What is a Queue?\n",
        "\n",
        "A queue is a data structure used for storing data, much like Linked Lists and Stacks. However, in a queue, the order in which data arrives is important. Think of a queue as a line of people or things waiting to be served in a specific order, starting from the front of the line and proceeding sequentially.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Definition:**\n",
        "- A queue is an ordered list where insertions are made at one end (rear), and deletions occur at the other end (front).\n",
        "- The first element inserted is the first one to be deleted, following the \"First in, First out\" (FIFO) or \"Last in, Last out\" (LILO) principle.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just like in Stacks, there are special terms for the two primary actions performed on a queue:\n",
        "- When an element is added to a queue, it's called \"EnQueue.\"\n",
        "- When an element is removed from the queue, it's referred to as \"DeQueue.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Keep in mind that DeQueueing an empty queue is known as \"underflow,\" and EnQueuing an element in a full queue is called \"overflow.\" Typically, we treat these situations as exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "To visualize this, think of a snapshot of a queue, where elements are ready to be served at the front and new elements are ready to enter the queue at the rear:\n",

        "\n",
        "Think of a queue as a line at a reservation counter, which helps us understand the concept easily. When we join the line, we stand at the end of it, and the person at the front of the line is the next one to be served. They exit the queue and get their service.\n",
        "\n",
        "As this process continues, the next person in line moves to the front, exits the queue, and gets served. As each person at the front of the line gets their service and leaves, we gradually move closer to the front of the line. Eventually, we reach the front of the line, exit the queue, and get served.\n",
        "\n",
        "This behavior is particularly useful in situations where maintaining the order of arrival is essential. In a queue, the \"first come, first served\" principle ensures that people or items are processed in the order they joined the line, just like the reservation counter example.\n",
