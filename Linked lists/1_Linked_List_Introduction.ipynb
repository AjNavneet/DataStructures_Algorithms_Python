        "- Elements are connected in sequence using pointers.\n",

        "- It can dynamically grow or shrink in size while a program is running.\n",
        "- It can be extended as needed, up to the system's memory limits.\n",
        "- It's memory-efficient but requires some extra memory for the pointers.\n",
