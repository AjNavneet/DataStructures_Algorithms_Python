        "# Priority Queue: An Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In some scenarios, we encounter the need to find the minimum or maximum element from a collection of items. This is where the Priority Queue Abstract Data Type (ADT) comes into play. A priority queue is a data structure that offers essential operations, primarily \"Insert\" and \"DeleteMin\" (which not only returns but also removes the minimum element) or \"DeleteMax\" (for the maximum element).\n",
        "\n",
        "These operations are somewhat akin to the \"EnQueue\" and \"DeQueue\" operations of a regular queue. However, the distinctive feature of priority queues lies in the fact that the order in which elements are placed into the queue might not align with the order in which they are processed. A prime example of using a priority queue is job scheduling, where jobs are executed based on their prioritization rather than following a first-come, first-served approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Priority Queue Operations\n",
        "- **Insert**: Add an element to the priority queue.\n",
        "- **DeleteMax**: Remove and return the maximum element from the priority queue.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Priority Queue\n",
        "A priority queue can be classified into two main types:\n",
        "1. **Ascending-Priority Queue**: In this type, the item with the smallest key holds the highest priority, leading to the removal of the smallest element whenever necessary.\n",
        "2. **Descending-Priority Queue**: Here, the item with the largest key is given the highest priority, resulting in the removal of the maximum element as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both types are symmetric, but in this discussion, we'll focus on the ascending-priority queue.\n",

        "1. **Data Compression:** Priority queues are employed in data compression algorithms like Huffman Coding.\n",

        "4. **Event-Driven Simulation:** In scenarios like simulating customers waiting in a queue, priority queues help manage events based on their priority.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Selection Problem:** Priority queues are handy for solving the selection problem, which involves finding the kth-smallest element in a collection.\n",
