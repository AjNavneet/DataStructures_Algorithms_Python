        "Linked lists offer a significant advantage over arrays when it comes to inserting elements at any location, taking only O(1) time. However, searching for an element in a linked list takes O(n) time. To address this, we have a simple variation known as unrolled linked lists. In an unrolled linked list, multiple elements are stored in each node, referred to as a \"block.\"\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Cache Performance**:\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - When each block of the unrolled linked list is appropriately sized (e.g., fitting within the size of one cache line), the memory locality improves significantly. This results in better cache performance. Caching entire blocks at a time can be more efficient than individual elements, reducing memory access overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Space Efficiency**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Unrolled linked lists can save space due to the lower number of links required. In a doubly linked list, each element consists of data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node. However, in an unrolled linked list, the structure is optimized for each block, which can contain multiple elements. This reduces the overhead per element.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - For example, consider a node in a doubly linked list with 4-byte pointers, where each node takes 8 bytes. The allocation overhead could be between 8 and 16 bytes. If we want to store 1K items in the list, we'd have 16KB of overhead. In contrast, an unrolled linked list node (LinkedBlock) with a single node (12 bytes) and an array of 100 elements (400 bytes) plus overhead (8 bytes) would cost 428 bytes in total, or 4.28 bytes per element.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - For 1K items in the unrolled linked list, the overhead would be around 4.2KB, which is approximately 4 times more space-efficient than the original doubly linked list.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Even if the list becomes fragmented, and the item arrays are only half full on average, this space-saving advantage still holds. Additionally, the array size can be tuned to optimize overhead for specific applications.\n",
