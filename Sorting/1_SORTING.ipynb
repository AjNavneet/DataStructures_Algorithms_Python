        "\n",
        "### Based on Comparisons\n",
        "- Sorting algorithms can be categorized based on the number of comparisons they make. For comparison-based methods, the best-case scenario requires O(nlogn) comparisons, while the worst case demands O(n^2) comparisons. These algorithms evaluate elements by comparing keys and need a minimum of O(nlogn) comparisons for most inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In later sections, we'll explore non-comparison (linear) sorting algorithms like Counting Sort, Bucket Sort, and Radix Sort. These linear algorithms relax some constraints on inputs, improving efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Based on Swaps\n",
        "- Sorting algorithms are also classified by the number of swaps (or inversions) they perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Based on Memory Usage\n",
        "- Certain sorting algorithms are \"in place,\" meaning they require minimal memory (O(1) or O(logn)) to create temporary storage for sorting data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Based on Recursion\n",
        "- Sorting algorithms can be either recursive (e.g., Quick Sort) or non-recursive (e.g., Selection Sort and Insertion Sort). Some, like Merge Sort, combine both approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Based on Stability\n",
        "- A sorting algorithm is considered stable if, for any indices i and j where key R[i] equals key R[j], the relative order of R[i] and R[j] remains the same in the sorted list as it was in the original. Some sorting algorithms maintain the relative order of elements with equal keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Based on Adaptability\n",
