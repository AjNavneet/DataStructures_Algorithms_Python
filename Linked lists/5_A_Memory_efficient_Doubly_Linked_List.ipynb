        "In typical implementations, a doubly linked list includes elements with three components: data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node. This structure can be represented as:\n",

        "```\n",
        "Previous Node    Data    Next Node\n",
        "```\n",

        "In a memory-efficient approach, we optimize memory usage by employing only two pointers per element instead of three. The concept is to save memory while retaining the core functionality of a doubly linked list. This method can be especially useful in scenarios where efficient memory usage is a primary concern.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in a traditional doubly linked list, transitioning from node A to node B is direct using the forward and backward pointers. In a memory-efficient implementation, such a transition might require traversal from node A to the end of the list, reconstructing the backward pointer to node B as needed. This balance between memory efficiency and traversal efficiency is a practical choice in specific contexts.\n",

        "3. **Transitivity Property**:\n",
        "   - `(X @ Y) @ Z = X ⊕ (Y ⊕ Z)` (transitive): We can combine XOR operations and obtain the result in a transitive manner.\n",

        "Now, let's apply these properties to an example. Imagine we're at node C and want to move to node B, where C's `ptrdiff` is defined as `B @ D`. To get to B, we perform XOR on C's `ptrdiff` with D, resulting in B. This happens because:\n",
