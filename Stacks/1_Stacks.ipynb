        "**Definition:** A stack is an ordered list in which insertion and deletion are done at one end, called the top. The last element inserted is the first one to be deleted. Hence, it is called the Last in First Out (LIFO) or First in Last Out (FILO) list.\n",
        "\n",
        "- There are special names for the two operations that can be performed on a stack.\n",
        "  - When an element is inserted in a stack, it's called \"push,\" and when an element is removed from the stack, it's called \"pop.\"\n",

        "1. The manager assigns a new, more important task to the developer. In response, the developer puts the long-term project aside and starts working on the new task.\n",

        "   - Then, the developer answers the phone call.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. After completing the phone call, the developer retrieves the task that was temporarily set aside in the pending tray. They continue working on it.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. If another urgent call comes in, the same process is repeated. The new task is pushed into the pending tray while the developer attends to the phone call.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Eventually, the new task will be completed. At that point, the developer can \"pop\" the long-term project from the pending tray and continue working on it.\n",
