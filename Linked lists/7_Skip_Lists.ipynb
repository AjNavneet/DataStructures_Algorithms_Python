        "# Skip Lists\n",
        "\n",
        "Skip lists are a data structure that offers an alternative to balanced binary trees, especially when elements are not inserted in a random order. Binary trees can suffer from poor performance if elements are inserted sequentially, leading to degenerate structures. While randomly permutating input data is impractical, skip lists use probabilistic balancing rather than strict balancing to achieve quick search, insertion, and deletion of elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Advantages:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Quick Search, Insertion, and Deletion: Skip lists allow for rapid search, insertion, and deletion of elements in contrast to sorted linked lists, where these operations are O(n) as they require scanning the list node by node.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Probabilistic Balancing: Instead of enforcing strict balance, skip lists employ probabilistic balancing. They include additional pointers that allow intermediate nodes to be skipped, reducing the cost of scanning.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Linked List with Extra Pointers: At its core, a skip list is similar to a linked list but with additional pointers to facilitate skipping nodes. These pointers are used to make decisions using a random number generator.\n",
        "\n",
        "The fundamental idea behind skip lists is to improve the efficiency of operations by allowing larger steps when traversing the list, which leads to improved performance compared to traditional sorted linked lists.\n",
